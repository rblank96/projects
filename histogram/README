README for histo.c
Ryan Blankemeier, April 2017

Compiling:
	mygcc histo.c -o histo

Usage:
/* 
 * histo.c - make a histogram from input numbers
 * 
 * usage: histo
 * where:
 *   histo is called with no arguements, reads from stdin
 * output:
 *   read the stdin, prints updates and final histogram to stdout when ^D is
 *   pressed
 * stdin: the input numbers
 * stdout: histogram
 *
 * I used this histogram program to visualize bond angles in a simulation for Computational Structural Biology. If a protein has converged to the state, then I expect the histogram of bond angles over time to less spread out.

Example command lines:

  ./histo
  echo {1..100} | ./histo

Exit status:
  0 - success

Assumptions:
-  input is always a number, will exit if not.
- no command line arguements

Limitations:
- input of a non number will end the program
